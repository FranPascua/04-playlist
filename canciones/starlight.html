        <p>It's hard to hate on the truth I'm livin'<br>
            Enough man hate with the lies instead<br>
            Countin' cash with the phone to my ear<br>
            I feel like Meek on the private jet<br>
            Life or death, five-five, eyes, thighs, potential wifey<br>
            Industry, respected highly, in the street, protected</p>
        <p>I do know my man, but I don't trust him<br>
            Trust that, Ps in the trap disgustin'<br>

            South London's where I made my first hundred<br>
            Elastic bands, plastic bags, two in the blue like cheese and onion</p>
        <p>In Jamaica, quick vacation, travellin' my pastime<br>
            'Nough pollution in the ends<br>
            I flew back yard 'cah I wanna see starlight<br>
            Eritrean, skin tone cinnamon, I think I found my princess<br>
            My empress, still gonna impress<br>
            I know them man talk on the kid, but</p>

            Bags that I buy come filled with 50's<br>
            She a ten out of ten on a bad day<br>
            Public affection, I tell her, "Come kiss me"<br>
            I like mine obsessed, clingy<br>
            If she don't miss me, miss me<br>
            If she don't miss me, history<br>
            If she don't miss me, it's a mystery</p>
        <p>G17 in the party, tipsy<br>
            Don't drink, that's risky<br>
            Focus, shells gonna land like Disney<br>

            How you wanna take pics with the belts and the ring?<br>
            But don't help in the gym, 'nough girls datin' their biggest haters<br>
            How her boyfriend don't want her to win? Like rah<br>

            Seein' them stars on her private story<br>
            I dust that chick, she got no grace<br>
            See her ex men, she got no taste<br>
            Hip dip, she got no waist<br>

            All I worship and adore<br>
            In other words, please be true<br>
            In other words, I love you<br>
