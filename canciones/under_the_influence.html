        <p>(Translation)
            So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit<br>
            'Cause I was high when I wrote this, so suck my dick</p>
        <p>Two pills I pop, 'til my pupils swell up like two pennies<br>
            I'm Clint Eastwood in his mid-twenties<br>
            A young-ass man with a trash can strapped to the back of his ass<br>
            So the rats can't chew through his last pants<br>
            I'm like a mummy at night, fightin' with bright lightning<br>
            Frightened with five little white Vicadin pills bitin' him<br>
            I'm like a fuckin' wasp in the hospital lost<br>
            Stingin' the fuck outta everything I come across in the halls<br>
            I light a candle and place it up on the mantle<br>
            Grab a knife at the blade and stab you with the fuckin' handle<br>
            So when you find yourself wrapped up in the blinds, hurtin'<br>
            (Bitch, it's too late)<br>
            'Cause once you're hung from the drapes, it's curtains</p>
        <p>I'm an instigator, .380 slug penetrator<br>
            Degrading, creating murders to kill haters<br>
            Accused for every crime known through the equator<br>
            They knew I did it (uh-huh) for havin' blood on my 'gators<br>
            My weed'll hit your chest like a double barrel gauge and<br>
            I'm a black grenade that'll blow up in your face<br>
            With a fifth in me, when I guzzle Remy I do shit on purpose<br>
            You never hear me say, "Forgive me"<br>
            I'm snatchin' every penny, it gotta be that way, nigga, face it<br>
            That weed I sold to you, Brigade laced it<br>
            You hidin', I make the President get a facelift<br>
            Niggas just afraid, handin' me they bracelets<br>
            Chillin' in the lab wasted, I'm the type<br>
            That'll drink Kahlua and gin, throw up on the mic<br>
            Your life is ruined, you get socked right on sight<br>
            And even at the Million Man March, we gon' fight</p>
        <p>So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit<br>
            'Cause I was high when I wrote this, so suck my dick<br>
            'Cause I don't give a fuck if you don't like my shit<br>
            'Cause I was high when I wrote this, so suck my dick</p>
        <p>I'm a compulsive liar, settin' my preacher on fire<br>
            Slashin' your tires, flyin' down Fenkell and Meyers<br>
            Plates expired, soon as I'm hired I'm fired<br>
            Jackin' my dick off in a bed of barbed wire<br>
            (Hey, is Bizarre performin'?) Bitch, didn't you read the flyer?<br>
            The special invited guest will be Richard Pryor<br>
            (Aren't you a male dancer?) No, bitch, I'm retired<br>
            Fuckin' your bitch in the ass with a tire iron<br>
            I'm ripped, I'm on an acid trip<br>
            My DJ's in a coma for lettin' the record skip<br>
            Lettin' the record skip, lettin' the record skip (damn)<br>
            I'm fuckin' anything when I'm snortin'<br>
            It's gonna cost three-hundred dollars to get my pitbull an abortion<br>
            Some bitch asked for my autograph<br>
            I called her a whore, spit beer in her face and laughed<br>
            I drop bombs like I was in Vietnam<br>
            All bitches is hoes, even my stinkin'-ass mom</p>
        <p>Ayo, flashback, two feets, two deep up in that ass crack<br>
            Weed laced with somethin', nigga, pass that<br>
            In Amsterdam, we only hang out with hash rats<br>
            At a "Stop the Violence" rally, I blast gats<br>
            BMI my publishing, get your ass capped<br>
            The Kuniva, divide up your cash stack<br>
            Run your motherfuckin' pockets, ASAP<br>
            I don't need a platinum chain, bitch, I snatched Shaq's<br>
            Born loser, half thief and half black<br>
            Bring your boys and your guns and get laughed at<br>
            Bitch smacker, rich rappers get they Jag jacked
            And found chopped up in a trash bag</p>
        <p>We stranglin' rappers until the point they can't yell<br>
            'Cause they crew is full of fags and sweeter than bake sales<br>
            Reckless, come from behind and snatch your necklace<br>
            Gruesome and causin' more violence than nine hoodlums<br>
            I grapple your Adam's apple until it crackle<br>
            Run right past you, turn around, grab you and stab you<br>
            Get executed, 'cause I'm a Luni, I got a Yukmouth<br>
            And it's polluted, I cock it back, then shoot it<br>
            I love snatchin' up players, thugs and young ballers<br>
            Shoot up the household, even the young toddlers<br>
            Brigade barricade to bring the noise<br>
            While the bullets break your bones up like Christmas toys<br>
            If I go solo, I'm doin' a song with Boldevice-widtho<br>
            A big Chinese nigga screamin', "Kuniva, yo, yo"<br>
            I leave ya face leakin'<br>
            Run up in church and smack the preacher while he's preachin'<br>
            Take a swing at the deacon</p>
        <p>I used to tell cats that I sold weed and weight<br>
            I was straight 'til I got caught sellin' them shake<br>
            I'm ignorant, with the intent to snatch your rent<br>
            I got kicked out of summer camp for havin' sex in my tent<br>
            With the superintendent's daughter, my brain's out of order<br>
            I've been a Kon Artis since I was swimmin' in water<br>
            In cahoots with this nigga named Carlisle Von<br>
            Who got fired from UPS for tryna send you a bomb<br>
            (Special delivery) I sign to a local label for fun<br>
            Say I got cancer, get dropped, take the advancement and run<br>
            Drive-by you in the rain while you carry your son<br>
            Call your house and hang up on you for not givin' me none<br>
            Born straight up out a pussy but a son of a gun<br>
            Got a reputation for havin' niggas runnin' they funds<br>
            Used to be the type of nigga that was foldin' some ones<br>
            'Til I met your fat mama, now I'm rollin' in dough</p>
        <p>So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit<br>
            'Cause I was high when I wrote this, so suck my dick<br>
            'Cause I don't give a fuck if you don't like my shit<br>
            'Cause I was high when I wrote this, so suck my dick</p>
        <p>Suck my motherfuckin' dick<br>
            D12<br>
            Dirty motherfuckin' Dozen<br>
            Nasty like a stank slut bitch with thirty fuckin' husbands<br>
            Bizarre Kid, Swifty McVay, the Kon Artis<br>
            The Kuniva, Derty Harry, and Slim Shady</p>
