        <p>
            (Run that back, Turbo) </p>
        <p>You can get the biggest Chanel bag in the store if you want it<br>
            I gave 'em the drip, they sucked it up, I got 'em on it<br>
            I bought a new Patek, I had the watch, so I two-toned 'em<br>
            Takin' these drugs, I'm gon' be up until the mornin'<br>
            That ain't your car, you just a leaser, you don't own it<br>
            If I'm in the club, I got that fire when I'm performin'<br>
            The backend just came in, in all hunnids<br>
            Vibes galore, cute shit, they all on us<br>
            I'm from Atlanta where young niggas run shit<br>
            I know they hatin' on me, but I don't read comments<br>
            Whenever I tell her to come, she comin'<br>
            Whenever it's smoke, we ain't runnin'</p>
        <p>Drip too hard, don't stand too close<br>
            You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave<br>
            Doin' all these shows, I've been on the road<br>
            I don't care where I go, long as I get paid<br>
            Bad lil' vibe, she been on my mind<br>
            Soon as I get back, she gettin' slayed<br>
            Do this all the time, this ain't no surprise<br>
            Every other night, another movie gettin' made<br>
            Drip too hard, don't stand too close<br>
            You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave<br>
            Doin' all these shows, I've been on the road<br>
            I don't care where I go, long as I get paid<br>
            Bad lil' vibe, she been on my mind<br>
            Soon as I get back, she gettin' slayed<br>
            Do this all the time, this ain't no surprise (yeah)<br>
            Every other night, another movie gettin' made</p>
        <p>Every other night, another dollar gettin' made<br>
            Every other night started with a good day<br>
            I feel like a child, I got boogers in the face<br>
            Diamonds dancin' in the dial like this shit is a parade<br>
            I don't want your chain, Young GunWunna not a slave<br>
            I had to draw the line, too many bitches gettin' saved<br>
            TSA harass me, so I took a private plane<br>
            These pussy niggas lackin', while I'm workin' on my aim<br>
            Drip too hard, charge it to the card<br>
            Designer to the ground, I can barely spell the names<br>
            Drip too hard, caution on the floor<br>
            You gon' fuck around and drown tryna ride a nigga wave</p>
        <p>Drip too hard, don't stand too close<br>
            You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave<br>
            Doin' all these shows, I've been on the road<br>
            I don't care where I go, long as I get paid<br>
            Bad lil' vibe, she been on my mind<br>
            Soon as I get back, she gettin' slayed<br>
            Do this all the time, this ain't no surprise<br>
            Every other night, another movie gettin' made<br>
            Drip too hard, don't stand too close<br>
            You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave<br>
            Doin' all these shows, I've been on the road<br>
            I don't care where I go, long as I get paid<br>
            Bad lil' vibe, she been on my mind<br>

            Do this all the time, this ain't no surprise<br><br>
            Every other night, another movie gettin' made </p>
