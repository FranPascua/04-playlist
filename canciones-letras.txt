It's hard to hate on the truth I'm livin'
Enough man hate with the lies instead
Countin' cash with the phone to my ear
I feel like Meek on the private jet
Life or death, five-five, eyes, thighs, potential wifey
Industry, respected highly, in the street, protected

I do know my man, but I don't trust him
Trust that, Ps in the trap disgustin'
Stick with the stick, PVA, PDA, kiss that in public
South London where I made my
South London's where I made my first hundred
Elastic bands, plastic bags, two in the blue like cheese and onion

In Jamaica, quick vacation, travellin' my pastime
'Nough pollution in the ends
I flew back yard 'cah I wanna see starlight
Eritrean, skin tone cinnamon, I think I found my princess
My empress, still gonna impress
I know them man talk on the kid, but

It's hard to hate on the truth I'm livin'
Enough man hate with the lies instead
Countin' cash with the phone to my ear
I feel like Meek on the private jet
Life or death, five-five, eyes, thighs, potential wifey
Industry, respected highly, in the street, protected

Any girl that I'm datin' knows
Bags that I buy come filled with 50's
She a ten out of ten on a bad day
Public affection, I tell her, "Come kiss me"
I like mine obsessed, clingy
If she don't miss me, miss me
If she don't miss me, history
If she don't miss me, it's a mystery

G17 in the party, tipsy
Don't drink, that's risky
Focus, shells gonna land like Disney
I'll put him down under, Sydney
That's bae, I'll donate both my kidneys
True love, what the kid needs
And a girl from the Westest Indies
I know them man talk on the kid but

It's hard to hate on the truth I'm livin'
Enough man hate with the lies instead
Countin' cash with the phone to my ear

In this world that I'm in
How you wanna take pics with the belts and the ring?
But don't help in the gym, 'nough girls datin' their biggest haters
How her boyfriend don't want her to win? Like rah
And why my girlfriend never wanna see me
Have a good time out if she ain't there?

Yeah, yeah
Fly me to the moon, let me get some space
Seein' them stars on her private story
I dust that chick, she got no grace
See her ex men, she got no taste
Hip dip, she got no waist
Body snatched, servin' face (hold my hand)

Haha, hold my hand, personal trainer
Frequent flyer, bad, she tone and tan
Free my gang, 013's and 020's (darlin' miss me)
Oh, God, knows I miss my bros
I just got a call from jail on the phone and that might

Fill my heart with song
And let me sing forever more
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words, please be true
In other words, I love you
In other words, I love you
She wanna be with me (aye)

Fuck niggas, get money

You wanna sip mo' on my living room flo'?
Play Nintendo with cease a Leo
Pick up my phone say, "Poppa not home"
Sex all night, mad head in the morn'
Spin my V, smoke all my weed
Tattoo on tittie' sayin' B.I.G., now check it
You wanna be my main squeeze baby
Don't ya, you wanna gimme what I need baby
Won't ya, picture life as my wife, just think
Full length mink, fat X and O links

Bracelets to match, conversation was all that
Showed you the safe combinations and all that
Guess you could say you's the one I trusted
Who would ever think that you would spread like mustard?

Shit got hot, you sent feds to my spot
Took me to court, tried to take all I got
'Nother intricate plot, the bitch said, "I raped her"
Damn, why she wanna stick me for my paper?

My Moschino ho', my Versace hottie
Come to find out, you was fuckin' everybody
You knew about me, the fake ID
Cases in Virginia, body in D.C.
Woe, oh is me, that's what I get for trickin'
Pay my own bail, commence to ass kickin'

Lick in the door, wavin' the .44
All you heard was, "Poppa don't hit me no more"
Disrespect my clique, my shits imperial

Fuck around and made her milk box material
You feel me? Suckin' dick, runnin' your lips
'Cause of you, I'm on some real fuck-a-bitch shit

Fuck bitches, get money
Fuck niggas, get money

Nigga, better grab a seat
Grab on your dick as this bitch get deep
Deeper than the pussy of a bitch six feet
Stiff dicks feel sweet in this little petite
Young bitch from the street, guaranteed to stay down
Used to bring work outta' town on Greyhound

Now I'm Billboard bound, niggas pressed to hit it
Play me like a chicken, thinkin' I'm pressed to get it
Rather do the killin' than the stick up juxs
Or rather count a million while you eat my pussy

Push me to the limit, get my feelings in it
Get me open while I'm cummin' down your throat
You wanna be my main squeeze nigga
Don't ya?, you wanna lick between my knees nigga
Don't ya wanna see me whippin' your three down the ave
Blow up spots on bitches because I'm mad
Break up affairs, lick shots in the air
You get vexed, and start swingin' everywhere
Me shifty? Now you wanna pistol whip me?
Pull out your nine, while I cock on mine
Yeah what nigga? I ain't got time for this
So what nigga? I'm not tryin' to hear that shit
Now you wanna buy me diamonds and Armani suits
Adia Vinadini and Chanel lime boots
Things that make up for all the games and the lies
Hallmark cards, sayin', "I apologize"
Is you wit' me? How could you ever deceive me?
But payback's a bitch, motherfucka' believe me
Nah, I ain't gay, this ain't no lesbo' flow
Just a little somethin', to let you motherfuckers know

Fuck bitches, get money
Fuck niggas, get money
Fuck bitches, get money

(Run that back, Turbo)

You can get the biggest Chanel bag in the store if you want it
I gave 'em the drip, they sucked it up, I got 'em on it
I bought a new Patek, I had the watch, so I two-toned 'em
Takin' these drugs, I'm gon' be up until the mornin'
That ain't your car, you just a leaser, you don't own it
If I'm in the club, I got that fire when I'm performin'
The backend just came in, in all hunnids
Vibes galore, cute shit, they all on us
I'm from Atlanta where young niggas run shit
I know they hatin' on me, but I don't read comments
Whenever I tell her to come, she comin'
Whenever it's smoke, we ain't runnin'

Drip too hard, don't stand too close
You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Doin' all these shows, I've been on the road
I don't care where I go, long as I get paid
Bad lil' vibe, she been on my mind
Soon as I get back, she gettin' slayed
Do this all the time, this ain't no surprise
Every other night, another movie gettin' made
Drip too hard, don't stand too close
You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Doin' all these shows, I've been on the road
I don't care where I go, long as I get paid
Bad lil' vibe, she been on my mind
Soon as I get back, she gettin' slayed
Do this all the time, this ain't no surprise (yeah)
Every other night, another movie gettin' made

Every other night, another dollar gettin' made
Every other night started with a good day
I feel like a child, I got boogers in the face
Diamonds dancin' in the dial like this shit is a parade
I don't want your chain, Young GunWunna not a slave
I had to draw the line, too many bitches gettin' saved
TSA harass me, so I took a private plane
These pussy niggas lackin', while I'm workin' on my aim
Drip too hard, charge it to the card
Designer to the ground, I can barely spell the names
Drip too hard, caution on the floor
You gon' fuck around and drown tryna ride a nigga wave

Drip too hard, don't stand too close
You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Doin' all these shows, I've been on the road
I don't care where I go, long as I get paid

7-   Kendrick Lamar / United In Grief / Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers / 4:15
I hope you find some peace of mind in this lifetime
(Tell them, tell 'em, tell them the truth)
I hope you find some paradise
(Tell them, tell 'em the truth, tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em your)
I've been goin' through somethin'
One thousand, eight hundred and fifty-five days
I've been goin' through somethin'
Be afraid

What is a bitch in a miniskirt?
A man in his feelings with bitter nerve
What is a woman that really hurt?
A demon, you're better off killin' her
What is a relative makin' repetitive narratives on how you did it first?
That is a predator hit reverse
All of your presidents evil thirst

What is a neighborhood reputable?
That is a snitch on a pedestal
What is a house with a better view?
A family broken invariables
What is a rapper with jewelry?
A way that I show my maturity
What if I call on security?
That mean I'm callin' on God for purity

I went and got me a therapist
I can debate on my theories and sharin' it (whoa)
Consolidate all my comparisons
Humble enough because time was imperative (whoa)
Startin' to feel like it's only one answer to everything 
I don't know where it is (whoa)
Poppin' a bottle of Claritin (whoa)
Is it my hate or my arrogance? (whoa)

Shakin' and movin', like, what am I doin'? 
I'm flippin' my time through the Rolodex
Indulgin' myself and my life and my music 
The world that I'm in is a cul-de-sac
The world that we in is just menacin'
The demons portrayed as religionous
I wake in the mornin', another appointment 
I hope the psychologist listenin'

The new Mercedes with black G-Wagon
The "Where you from?" it was all for rap
I was twenty-eight years young, twenty mil' in tax
Bought a couple of mansions, just for practice
Five hunnid in jewelry, chain was magic
Never had it in public, late reaction
50K to cousins, post a caption
Pray none of my enemies hold me captive

I grieve different
I grieve different (huh)

I met her on the third night of Chicago
North America tour, my enclave
Fee-fi-fo-fum, she was a model
Dedicated to the songs I wrote in her Bible
Eyes light green penetratin' the moonlight
Hair done in a bun, energy in the room like

Big Bang for theory, God, hopin' you hear me
Phone out to ring, but tell the world I'm busy
Fair enough, green eyes said her mother didn't care enough
Sympathize when her daddy in the chain gang
Her first brother got killed, he was twenty-one
I was nine when they put Lamont in the grave
Heartbroken when Estelle didn't say goodbye
Chad left his body after we FaceTimed
Green eyes said you'd be okay, first tour, sex the pain away

I grieve different
I grieve different (huh)

The new Mercedes with black G-Wagon
The "Where you from?" it was all for rap
I was twenty-eight years young, twenty mil' in tax
Bought a couple of mansions, just for practice
Five hunnid in jewelry, chain was magic
Never had it in public, late reaction
50K to cousins, post a caption
Pray none of my enemies hold me captive

So what, paralyzed, the county buildin' controlled us
I bought a Rolex watch, I only wore it once
I bought infinity pools I never swimmed in
I watched Keem buy four cars in four months
You know the family dynamics on repeat
The insecurities locked down on PC

I bought a .223, nobody peace treat
You won't doo-doo me, I smell TNT
Dave bought him a Porsche, so I bought a Porsche
Paid lottery for it, I ain't want it in portions
Poverty was the case, but the money wipin' the tears away

I grieve different
(Everybody grieves different)
(Everybody grieves different)
I grieve different (huh)


8-   Kanye West / All Mine / EP:ye / 2:26
Yeah, you supermodel thick
Damn, that ass bustin' out the bottom
I'ma lose my mind in it, crazy that medulla oblongata
Get to rubbin' on my lamp
Get the genie out the bottle

Fuck it up, fuck it up
Pussy good, gon' back it up
Pipe her up, I'ma pipe her up
Make her mine, I done fell in love
Juicy thing, make that pussy sing
One more time, baby, do it big
Make it cry, come, go hold this shit

Yeah, you supermodel thick
Damn, that ass bustin' out the bottom
I'ma lose my mind in it, crazy that medulla oblongata
Get to rubbin' on my lamp
Get the genie out the bottle

If I pull up with a Kerry Washington
That's gon' be an enormous scandal
I could have Naomi Campbell
And still might want me a Stormy Daniels
Sometimes, you gotta bag the boss up
I call that takin' Corey Gambles
Find yourself up in the food court
You might have to enjoy your sample
All these thots on Christian Mingle
Almost what got Tristan single
If you don't ball like him or Kobe
Guarantee that bitch gonna leave you
Ayy, time is extremely valuable
And I prefer to waste it
On girls that's basic
That's just some Ye shit
Right now, let's do what we want
Let's have a threesome, me, you and the blunt
I love your titties 'cause they prove I can focus on two things at once

Yeah, you supermodel thick
Damn, that ass bustin' out the bottom
I'ma lose my mind in it, crazy that medulla oblongata
Get to rubbin' on my lamp
Get the genie out the bottle
Get the genie out the bottle

Let me hit it raw like fuck the outcome
Ayy, none of us'd be here without cum
Ayy, if it ain't all about the income
Ayy, ayy, let me see you gon' ahead and spend some
Ayy, if you drivin' 'round in some Dri-Fit
Ayy, I'ma think that you the type to dry snitch
Hmm-mm, If I see you pull up with the three stripes
Ayy, ayy, I'ma fuck around and make you my bitch

Yeah, you supermodel thick
Damn, that ass bustin' out the bottom
I'ma lose my mind in it, crazy that medulla oblongata
Get to rubbin' on my lamp
Get the genie out the bottle
Get the genie out the bottle

Vino tu Dios con amigas, hicimos orgía
Ya va 5 días sin dormir ni comer
Qué tanta energía tendrán estas minas
Que siempre que activan se corta la sed
Compraron escabio y también golosinas
Sin globos no hay fiesta y sin mí no hay pastel
Ella también debe estar de after
Llamada perdida y caviar en mi cel

Pipi, este VIP lleno de follow
Like de Instagram y bombazo por todos
Algunas fotos siempre se destacan
La calle se encarga de ver lo que somos
Sin filtro la tana mostrando el valor
Roque en el hielo no siente el calor
Ellas haciéndome en alto los coros
Le hago canciones a las que enamoro

Ando con lo inesperado que todos esperan me traje esto solo
Un diseñador resguardando mis pies como un fuckin tesoro
Llegué con la joya en las llantas brillando y todo
Ella besó mi Don Roque y ahora quiere uno todo de oro

(Ice) Todo de oro
(Ice) Todo de oro
(Ice) Ella besó mi Don Roque y ahora quiere uno todo de oro
(Ice) Todo de oro (0800-Donrouch)
(Ice) Todo de oro (La joya en la llanta brillando)
(Ice) Ella besó mi Don Roque y ahora quiere uno todo de oro

Diamantes en mi piel no van a dejarme solo
Diamantes que no pueden traicionarme
Yeah yeah
Diamantes en mi fuckin funeral yeah
Si quiere comprar con Dios
0800 DonRouch
Mi pecho partiéndose en dos
El Dinero y la fama impecable
Pero todos estos trappers no tienen valor
Mi brillo era inimaginable
0-8-0-0, Don Rouch no es un precio charlable
Ahora que llueva el hielo, diamantes del cielo, esto es inevitable
Yeah yeah yeah

Todo de oro
Todo de oro
Si ahora causa furor cuanto tenga el diamante en su piel va llevarselo a todos
Mi set y su set combinando perfecto habla de lo que somos
Porque ella besó mi don Roque y ahora tiene uno todo de oro

(Ice) Todo de oro
(Ice) Todo de oro
(Ice) Ella besó mi Don Roque y ahora quiere uno todo de oro
(Ice) Todo de oro (0800-Donrouch)
(Ice) Todo de oro (La joya en la llanta brillando)
(Ice) Ella besó mi Don Roque y ahora quiere uno todo de oro

Todo de oro
Todo de oro
Todo de oro
Todo de, todo de
Todo de oro
Todo de oro
Todo de oro
Todo de, todo de

(Translation)
So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this, so suck my dick

Two pills I pop, 'til my pupils swell up like two pennies
I'm Clint Eastwood in his mid-twenties
A young-ass man with a trash can strapped to the back of his ass
So the rats can't chew through his last pants
I'm like a mummy at night, fightin' with bright lightning
Frightened with five little white Vicadin pills bitin' him
I'm like a fuckin' wasp in the hospital lost
Stingin' the fuck outta everything I come across in the halls
I light a candle and place it up on the mantle
Grab a knife at the blade and stab you with the fuckin' handle
So when you find yourself wrapped up in the blinds, hurtin'
(Bitch, it's too late)
'Cause once you're hung from the drapes, it's curtains

I'm an instigator, .380 slug penetrator
Degrading, creating murders to kill haters
Accused for every crime known through the equator
They knew I did it (uh-huh) for havin' blood on my 'gators
My weed'll hit your chest like a double barrel gauge and
I'm a black grenade that'll blow up in your face
With a fifth in me, when I guzzle Remy I do shit on purpose
You never hear me say, "Forgive me"
I'm snatchin' every penny, it gotta be that way, nigga, face it
That weed I sold to you, Brigade laced it
You hidin', I make the President get a facelift
Niggas just afraid, handin' me they bracelets
Chillin' in the lab wasted, I'm the type
That'll drink Kahlua and gin, throw up on the mic
Your life is ruined, you get socked right on sight
And even at the Million Man March, we gon' fight

So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this, so suck my dick
'Cause I don't give a fuck if you don't like my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this, so suck my dick

I'm a compulsive liar, settin' my preacher on fire
Slashin' your tires, flyin' down Fenkell and Meyers
Plates expired, soon as I'm hired I'm fired
Jackin' my dick off in a bed of barbed wire
(Hey, is Bizarre performin'?) Bitch, didn't you read the flyer?
The special invited guest will be Richard Pryor
(Aren't you a male dancer?) No, bitch, I'm retired
Fuckin' your bitch in the ass with a tire iron
I'm ripped, I'm on an acid trip
My DJ's in a coma for lettin' the record skip
Lettin' the record skip, lettin' the record skip (damn)
I'm fuckin' anything when I'm snortin'
It's gonna cost three-hundred dollars to get my pitbull an abortion
Some bitch asked for my autograph
I called her a whore, spit beer in her face and laughed
I drop bombs like I was in Vietnam
All bitches is hoes, even my stinkin'-ass mom

Ayo, flashback, two feets, two deep up in that ass crack
Weed laced with somethin', nigga, pass that
In Amsterdam, we only hang out with hash rats
At a "Stop the Violence" rally, I blast gats
BMI my publishing, get your ass capped
The Kuniva, divide up your cash stack
Run your motherfuckin' pockets, ASAP
I don't need a platinum chain, bitch, I snatched Shaq's
Born loser, half thief and half black
Bring your boys and your guns and get laughed at
Bitch smacker, rich rappers get they Jag jacked
And found chopped up in a trash bag

We stranglin' rappers until the point they can't yell
'Cause they crew is full of fags and sweeter than bake sales
Reckless, come from behind and snatch your necklace
Gruesome and causin' more violence than nine hoodlums
I grapple your Adam's apple until it crackle
Run right past you, turn around, grab you and stab you
Get executed, 'cause I'm a Luni, I got a Yukmouth
And it's polluted, I cock it back, then shoot it
I love snatchin' up players, thugs and young ballers
Shoot up the household, even the young toddlers
Brigade barricade to bring the noise
While the bullets break your bones up like Christmas toys
If I go solo, I'm doin' a song with Boldevice-widtho
A big Chinese nigga screamin', "Kuniva, yo, yo"
I leave ya face leakin'
Run up in church and smack the preacher while he's preachin'
Take a swing at the deacon

I used to tell cats that I sold weed and weight
I was straight 'til I got caught sellin' them shake
I'm ignorant, with the intent to snatch your rent
I got kicked out of summer camp for havin' sex in my tent
With the superintendent's daughter, my brain's out of order
I've been a Kon Artis since I was swimmin' in water
In cahoots with this nigga named Carlisle Von
Who got fired from UPS for tryna send you a bomb
(Special delivery) I sign to a local label for fun
Say I got cancer, get dropped, take the advancement and run
Drive-by you in the rain while you carry your son
Call your house and hang up on you for not givin' me none
Born straight up out a pussy but a son of a gun
Got a reputation for havin' niggas runnin' they funds
Used to be the type of nigga that was foldin' some ones
'Til I met your fat mama, now I'm rollin' in dough

So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this, so suck my dick
'Cause I don't give a fuck if you don't like my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this, so suck my dick

Suck my motherfuckin' dick
D12
Dirty motherfuckin' Dozen
Nasty like a stank slut bitch with thirty fuckin' husbands
Bizarre Kid, Swifty McVay, the Kon Artis
The Kuniva, Derty Harry, and Slim Shady
