        Hunnid racks in the bag, that's a honey bun<br>
        Baby OG, I been runnin' these streets<br>
        Got the game from Lashawn, I'm my mama's son<br>
        Learned 'bout the triple cross when I was young<br>
        And I know I ain't goin' so I keep a gun<br>
        I flew to Paris just to buy some Dior<br>
        She beggin' for attention, I don't see her<br>

        I'm livin' like "Thriller", I only come out at the night time<br>
        She don't fuck with liquor, don't like bein' tipsy<br>
        She don't do the Henny, just white wine (what she do?)<br>
        Pop the cork on some new Pinot Grigio (yeah)<br>
        I pull up in the Porsche wit' a freaky ho (zoom)<br>
        Park the Porsche and pull up in a Lambo<br>
