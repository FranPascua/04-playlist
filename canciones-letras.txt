Get 'em, get 'em, oh

Oh, oh (get 'em)
Oh (gettin' big, goin' up)
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh

If I tell you once, won't tell you twice, yeah
I'm a thief in the night (thief in the night)

I did some wrong (oh, oh), but I'm always right (oh, oh)
Said I know how to shoot (oh, oh) and I know how to fight
If I tell you once, won't tell you twice
I'm real discreet, like a thief in the night (look)

If I call you bae, you bae for the day
Or a bae for the night, you not my wife
She want a killer to fuck all night
I wanna fuck on a thot, gimme head all night
AP, big rocks, in the hood with the 'Rillas
5K on the dinner, bring three hundred thou' to the dealer

I did some wrong (oh, oh), but I'm always right (oh, oh)
Said I know how to shoot (oh, oh) and I know how to fight
If I tell you once, won't tell you twice
I'm real discreet, like a thief in the night (Baby)

I'm rich but I'm ridin', I'm low on exotic 
I'm 'bout to fly out and go get me some
Nothin' ain't seen, all this money on me 
Hunnid racks in the bag, that's a honey bun
Baby OG, I been runnin' these streets
Got the game from Lashawn, I'm my mama's son
Learned 'bout the triple cross when I was young 
And I know I ain't goin' so I keep a gun
I flew to Paris just to buy some Dior
She beggin' for attention, I don't see her
C.I.P Pop, I wish that you could see us
Million cash plus whenever I go re-up
I got some niggas in the street, won't beat me
I got the industry tryna be me
I just go Ray Charles, they can't see me
I'm in a Rolls Royce with a RiRi

I did some wrong (oh, oh), but I'm always right (oh, oh)
Said I know how to shoot (oh, oh) and I know how to fight
If I tell you once, won't tell you twice
I'm real discreet, like a thief in the night

Yeah, like a thief in the night (thief)
I pull up, give her D for the night (uh-huh)
Tryna fuck in the V, it's aight (let's fuck)
We can't fuck up my seats 'cause they white (that's my seats, watch my motherfuckin' seats)
I'm livin' like "Thriller", I only come out at the night time
She don't fuck with liquor, don't like bein' tipsy
She don't do the Henny, just white wine (what she do?)
Pop the cork on some new Pinot Grigio (yeah)
I pull up in the Porsche wit' a freaky ho (zoom)
Park the Porsche and pull up in a Lambo 
I hop out, Major Payne, rockin' camo (yessir)
Think she cute, make her fuck, let her man go (she cute)
Like to shoot, light you up, bitch, I'm Rambo
Cuban link full of rocks, it's a choker (oh)
Rest in peace to the Pop, make me smoke ya

I did some wrong (oh, oh), but I'm always right (oh, oh)
Said I know how to shoot (oh, oh) and I know how to fight
If I tell you once, won't tell you twice
I'm real discreet, like a thief in the night

No Hillary, but the mind on the bill
Give me that topnotch milf
A house and a few more mills
Bitch, I'm a stunner, you a done donna
No, I don't drive, but I ride like a hummer (uh)
Rise in the winter, blow up in the summer
Can't sleep on me like a goddamn slumber
Man, I'm so raw, G-star got nothing on moi
Nigger you are not up to par
Hitting the ball, hitting the ball out the park
Go MVP with the bars
Never gon' do what a nigga don't like
That's just me and how I live life
Don't care if I'm wrong or right
It just gotta feel alright
Who got the juice, who got the juice
If it ain't juice Norris
You know that coup foreign
What you finna to do for it, uh
Nothing really matters if you ain't afraid of losin'
I'm afraid of losin', every bar is here to prove it (uh)

Bhavi the brodie, we coming correct
Came to deliver, we came to collect
She fell in love with the way we finesse
Honour the code, follow the set (prr)
Sometimes I feel like I need to leave and
Just take a trip to the south (to the south)
Get my check, then check your chick
Then steal your chick and I'm out (pull up)
Finally I found myself a quest
Pass the pen and I'ma pass the uh
Feel the passion burning in my chest
And it's safe to say the homie feelin' blessed
I remember when I told myself that one day I'ma be the G.O.A.T
And, and, and I still feel the same way a'ight
Can't you see I'm travelin'
On my way to wonderland
All my life been bufferin'
Stu-stu-stu-stu-stutterin'
Who got the juice, who got the sauce
Who break the rules, who killed your boss (aye)
Who break the rules, who killed your boss, boss, boss (oh)

She wanna be with me (aye)
